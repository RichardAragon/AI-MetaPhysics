Here's a general outline of how the algorithm might look using Python:

Data Collection Phase:

Define input variables and their corresponding data types, along with required units and ranges.
Read in raw data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, databases).
Preprocess the data to remove duplicates, filter invalid entries, transform categorical variables into numerical ones if needed, etc.
Store preprocessed data in memory or disk storage for later use.
import pandas as pd

def load_data(filepath):
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    # Filter rows containing errors/missing values
    df = df[(df['Age'].notnull()) & (df['Income'] > 0)]
    # Convert age from 'years old' to years (float division)
    df['Age'] /= 365.25
    return df
Axiom Formulation Phase:

Create initial set of axioms based on existing research, theoretical foundations, or intuitive reasoning.
Use logic programming languages (such as Prolog) to encode and validate axioms.
Implement automated proof checkers to verify that all logical implications follow from these axioms.
# Load logic programming library
from pyparsing import *
grammar = """
start : expression % assigns result to variable
     | True
     | False
     | Not expression
     | And(expression, expression)
     | Or(expression, expression)
     | Implies(expression, expression)
     | Equivalence(expression, expression)
  
expression : term + ("+" ~ "+" ~ term)*
  
term   : factor ("*" ~ "*" ~ factor)*
  
factor  : NUMBER | VARIABLE | LPAR expression RPAR | NOT factor | UMINUS factor

number : WORD(numb)
numb  : (('.'|')')*(digits*((E|G) digits))*[msp] digit*("." digit*)?
msp     : ('E'|'G')('+'|' ')
digit   : DIGIT
"""

def parse_axioms(input_string):
    lexer = Lexer(grammar)
    tokens = lexer.parseString(input_string)
    ast = parser().exprList.pop()
    return ast
Simulation Execution Phase:

Specify inputs and outputs for each subsystem of the larger system under study.
Write simulation scripts using tools like MATLAB, Mathematica, or OpenModelica.
Run simulations and store results for subsequent analysis.
# Call external simulator (Matlab) via subprocess module
import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
res = eng.simulink('/home/user/Simulations/my_model', {'Input1': [4, 8], 'Input2': [2, 6]})
# Close Matlab engine after usage
eng.quit()
Optimization Phase:

Translate mathematical expressions representing objective functions and constraints into equivalent symbolic forms.
Employ optimization libraries (like Gurobi or CVXPY) to solve constrained or unconstrained optimization problems.
Iteratively refine solutions until convergence criteria are satisfied.
import cvxpy as cp
from cvxopt.solvers import options, glpk

# Define decision variables
x = cp.Variable(3)
y = cp.Variable(2)
z = cp.Variable(1)

# Define objective function and constraints
obj = cp.Maximize(cp.multiply(x[0], y[0]) + cp.add(x[1]*y[1], z))
c = [x[0]+y[0] <= 5,
          cp.norm(y)**2 <= 9,
          3*z <= cp.sum(x),
          y >= 0,
          x >= 0]

# Configure optimization parameters
options['show_progress'] = true
glpk.set_option('precision', 0.001)
glpk.set_option('timelimit', 10)

# Set up and solve optimization problem
prob = cp.Problem(obj, c)
result = prob.solve(solver=CP.SOLVER_GUROBI)
print("Optimal value:", result.value)
for var in [x, y, z]:
    print(f"{var.name}: {var.value}")
Here we have defined three variables x, y, and z. The objective function is given by multiplying two elements of vector x with corresponding elements of vector y plus adding another element of vector z. We also have some constraints which must be met during optimization. Finally, we configure optimization parameters such as progress display and time limit, then call the optimizer to solve our optimization problem using GLPK_MI as the selected solver. Once the optimization has finished running, we output the optimal value and the final values assigned to each decision variable.
